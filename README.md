Guess my color
===========

Game using artoo and sphero, the objective of the game is to guess the color by saying its name and sphero
will keep changing color until you have guess all of them.

Here you can see a video of how it works: http://youtu.be/xmG1uYWNNik

I was inspired to create this from this article: http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2013/08/06/robots-as-tools-toys-and-teachers/

    You can, for example, program the ball to change colors on command.
    Kids could not only learn the words for colors in English,
    but you could program the ball to change colors when the commands
    were given in another language “rojo” or “rouge.”

This is just a proof of concept but I will continue to develop it with better shape.

If you have any feedback feel free to open an issue.
